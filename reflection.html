            <p>In my opinion, responsive design is to ensure users to get best experience when they browse the same web page
                 on various resolution screens, and we make the website look good through reasonable design schemes and 
                 standardized technical strategies. It responds to the changes of media and viewport. As a result of the 
                 responsive design, the web page would have different layout structure, layout design and presentation of
                  different amounts of information.</p>
            <p>How does responsive design work? We use media queries to create one CSS which contains the capacity to adapt a 
                variety of device sizes. Once the page is loaded on a specific device, it will firstly detect the size of the
                 device's viewport, and then load the device-specific style. Unique style sheets are set for different media types.</p>
            <p>The responsive design is based on a combination of technologies such as mobile layouts, flexible pictures, flexible
                 tables, flexible videos and media queries. We use the layout of percentage to create a flexible interface and use
                  media queries to limit the range of elements. These two points are the core of responsive design. The layout of 
                  fixed-width pixel cannot implement variable and unknown devices.</p>
            <p>In my responsive design, I firstly added the viewport meta tag in my html files. After setting "width=device-width", 
              the width of the browser is consistent with the media viewport. The setting "initial-scale=1.0" makes the size of the
               presented content equal to that of the original content. Secondly, I used the max-width property for the images and 
               used viewport width for the text size. Lastly, I used media queries to define different styles for different sizes. </p>
            <p>By doing this responsive design, I learn about related knowledge and technologies. The rate at which people browse 
              the web via mobile phones is rising. It's not easy to achieve a good experience for users who have different devices 
              and various screen sizes. But if we make efforts to do it well, it can result in a more user friendly experience. 
              At the same time, it becomes much easier for us to maintain. </p>
